# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should:
- Be in PNG format
- Use the extension's blue gradient theme (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Include a simple spark or AI-related symbol
- Be square with transparent backgrounds

## Temporary Workaround

If you don't have icon files, you can temporarily use any PNG files with the correct names to test the extension, or create simple colored squares as placeholders.
